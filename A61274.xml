            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>FROM the Diſciples ſhewing our Lord the Buildings of the Temple, He takes occaſion,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 1.</note> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Chapter,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 2.</note> to foretell the lamentable Extermination of the Jewiſh People, and the utter Ruine of that Holy Place. Satisfying herein,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> ſo far as his Divine Wiſdom thought fit, their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity; who deſired to know the preciſe time of thoſe dreadful Puniſhments God kept in reſerve, for the malicious Enemies of his Son, and the Truth. But, in regard there was one Day a more eminent Diſcrimination to be made, between them that believed in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and them that believed him not; a Diſtinction, not confined to one particular Place or People, but Univerſal, and ſuch as none of the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> can poſſibly be exempted from; a Proceſs and Sentence of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50998:3"/>that infinite conſequence, that the Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> horrible as it was, ſhould be but a faint and feeble Image of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of the Lord, and the Terrors of the Wicked in That Day; our Saviour does therefore prudently improve this Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity into a Diſcourſe concerning That alſo. In which, he repreſents it as a Thing of the higheſt and moſt general Concernment; the Laſt Great Revolution, which the Perſons to whom he ſpoke, and all Chriſtians after them, were obliged daily and hourly to expect, and diligently to prepare for. Upon which account it is, that he expreſſes himſelf in ſuch Terms, as might awaken their Souls, and quicken their Care; by ſhortening its diſtance to the Eye, and declaring it not only certain, but nigh at hand to every one of them. For thus (according to the known uſage of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick ſtyle, involving withal, and looking forward to the Antitype, when the Type is more directly mentioned) I underſtand that paſſage;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 34.35.</note> 
               <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, This Generation ſhall not paſs till all theſe things be fulfilled; Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but my words ſhall not paſs away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several remarkable Diſpenſations of an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50998:3"/>avenging Providence had been exhibited to the preceding Ages of the World, which might and ſhould have been abundant Intimations,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 37.</note> that God would not fail to call Sinners to Judgment, and repay them to their face. Theſe ought to have made Men wary, and prevailed upon them to live, as becomes thoſe, who know they muſt render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Actions. But, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many repeated Inſtances of a ſevere Reckoning,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 38, 39.</note> our Lord foreſaw, that there would be vaſt numbers ſtill unmov'd, and unprepar'd; inſomuch, that the Son of Man's Coming ſhould not more reſemble the Flood, which drowned the old World, in the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Univerſal Extent of the Judgment, than it would in the Surpriſe and Indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men to meet him. Juſt ſuch another ſweeping Deluge ſhall This prove, as Swift, as Fatal, as Aſtoniſhing, to all, who by timely Thought and due Vigilance are not ready for the ſudden and amazing Separations it ſhall make. <hi>Watch therefore,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>V.</hi> 40.41.</note>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>V.</hi> 42.</note> for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.</hi> And farther yet; Becauſe we ought to be much aſhamed; that <hi>the Children of this World ſhould be ſo much wiſer in their Generation than the Children of Light;</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50998:4"/>the Example of a careful Houſholder is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, as a freſh Incentive to our Diligence. For if He would moſt certainly have watch'd, could he but have learn'd at what time the Thief would come; how much more ought We to be upon Our Guard againſt the Son of Man's coming,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 43.</note> which for its own ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and our unpreparedneſs, is compared to that of a Thief in the Night. If He, I ſay, the extremity of whoſe damage is ſuppoſed not to exceed the Breaking up of his Houſe, and the loſs of ſuch Goods, as Time and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence have a thouſand ways of Reſtoring; how much rather We, whoſe Treaſure is greater, and whoſe Danger is infinitely greater, and whoſe Loſs, if once ſuſtained, is for ever irreparable! <hi>Therefore be ye alſo ready,</hi> for, as at a time when that Houſholder is not aware, the Thief ruſhes in upon him, ſo <hi>in ſuch an hour as you think not, the ſon of man cometh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I take to be the true order and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of what our Lord hath deliver'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this matter, from Ver. 29. to that of my Text incluſively. Upon which, that I may diſcourſe in the moſt clear and familiar, as well as what I conceive the moſt profitable manner, give me leave to obſerve this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wing method.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50998:4"/>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt:</hi> To propoſe ſome Obſervations leading to a right apprehenſion of the Words themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Secondly:</hi> Coming up to the Point in my Text, To ſay ſomething of the Sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Son of Man's coming, and how that Quality belongs to it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Thirdly:</hi> To lay down ſome Directions, how we may be ready to meet him, at that Coming of His.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. After all which, if the Time will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me to draw an Inference or two from the foregoing Heads, I ſhall fully ſatisfie my Intentions in the Choice of this Subject.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I begin with ſome Obſervations relating to the Words themſelves, and preliminary to the main Buſineſs, and immediate Intent of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And here, firſt of all, I cannot but take notice, That <hi>the Son of Man's coming,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that Expreſſion means, is not at all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be proved, but declared only, and ſpoken of as a ſufficiently known and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Truth. The manner of it indeed, and his Pompous Appearance, are largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; the Suddenneſs of it, and the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the World, are particularly foretold;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50998:5"/>many importunate Exhortations to qualify, and put our Souls in due poſture for it, very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly inſiſted upon; and the end of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, both in This and the following Chapter, manifeſtly declar'd to be, the taking an account of his Servants, Examining how each of them had acquitted themſelves in their reſpective Truſts and Capacities, and Awarding to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one his Portion and Recompence accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. From all which it is exceeding plain, that the laſt General Judgment is meant by it, when <hi>All men ſhall give account for their own works, and they that have done Good ſhall go into Life Everlaſting, and they that have done Evil into everlaſting Fire.</hi> But of the Judgment it ſelf, there are no pains taken to argue, and evince, that ſuch a thing ſhould be; becauſe this was already an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd notorious Principle: And none of thoſe with whom our Saviour now converſed, were ſo bold to call it publickly into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ſo ignorant, as to admit any doubt concerning it, in their own private Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Conſciences.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But ſecondly. Though by this <hi>Coming of the Son of Man</hi> the General Judgment be principally intended, yet to any that ſhall
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50998:5"/>compare this paſſage in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> with its parallel in St. <hi>mark,</hi> it will be very obvious,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mark</hi> 13.37</note> that This cannot be the only thing meant by it. Our Lord adds there, <hi>What I ſay unto You, I ſay unto All:</hi> Intimating hereby, that the Cautions he lays down, and the Reaſon of them concern not ſome few, or one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration only, but were equally applicable to every ſucceeding Age of Chriſtians to the World's end. It is alſo evident even to ſenſe, that the Day of Judgment, literally ſpeaking, did not ſurpriſe thoſe very perſons, to whom theſe Oracles were delivered: There having run out ſince their deaths, more than ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years already;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 36.</note> and at what diſtance that Day may ſtill be from us, none but God can tell. If then we can diſcover any other thing, which every man is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned to provide for, and which may very juſtly be termed the Coming of the Lord, there will be all the reaſon in the world for extending our Saviour's diſcourſe to That alſo. Now ſuch in every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is the Day of our Death; This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every ſingle man in particular, what the Laſt Judgment will be to the whole world in general. The ſuddenneſs of its
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50998:6"/>coming may be the ſame; the ſtate of our Souls will be the ſame, and conſequently the Danger of being unprovided muſt needs be the ſame. For theſe Two have a ſtrict connexion, and abſolute dependance upon one another. And <q>for this reaſon (ſays St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>) he ſpeaks to All,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epid.</hi> 80. <hi>ad Helych.</hi>
                  </note> things which in their literal ſenſe belong to ſuch only as ſhall be found alive at his ſecond Coming, becauſe they do really in this reſpect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern All, that the Laſt Day ſhall find them in the very ſame condition, that the laſt day of their Life left them in. Such as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one dies, ſuch ſhall he come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And hence it is his duty to watch for the Lord's Coming, becauſe that Laſt Coming ſhall find him unprepared, if his own death found him ſo.</q> To the ſame purpoſe St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> in his Comment on <hi>Joel</hi> 2. <q>
                  <hi>By the Day of the Lord,</hi> ſays he, underſtand the Day of Judgment, or the Day of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular man's Departure out of the Body. For what ſhall be done in the Day of Judgment to All, the ſame is fulfilled, as to each ſingle perſon, in the Day of his Death.</q> With theſe two Fathers agree the Generality of ancient Interpreters, and upon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50998:6"/>the ſame ground too. So little it ſeems were thoſe Good men ſenſible of a middle ſtate for the Purging men's Souls by Fire, or any other way of putting thoſe into a Capacity for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven afterwards, who were not ſo at their Entrance into the Chambers of the Dead,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly. It is well worth a Remark, That although both theſe <hi>Comings of the Son of Man</hi> be intended, yet That only of the Laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is mentioned. And a great deal of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there is, why it ſhould be ſo: Becauſe This being the Laſt ſolemn Appearance of Quick and Dead, attended with all that Terror and Pomp, which we find deſcribed in Scripture, would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally (if any thing would) work mens minds up to a becoming Senſe, and mighty Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Danger. Whereas Death is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo ordinary, that the very Commonneſs of it, (which ought in reaſon to move us the more) hath render'd it familiar: And therefore This would have been mentioned, as it is ſeen and diſcourſed of every day, without any great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Efficacy or Impreſſion. To which we muſt add too, that, were it not for that Great Audit before God's Tribunal, there can be no account at all given, why we ſhould be in any degree ſolicitous to prepare for Death. For
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50998:7"/>what is This, conſidered in it ſelf, but only a Diſſolution of Soul and Body, a State of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Oblivion; a Fate common to all things under the Sun? And ſo not worth the leaſt part of our Care and Concern, any otherwiſe than as it conſigns us over, and leads us direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that General Hearing. But upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, every body muſt confeſs, that we lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſtricteſt Engagements to work, while this ſhort <hi>Day</hi> of Life continues, becauſe Our Sun draws toward ſetting, and the <hi>Night comes on</hi> apace <hi>wherein no man can work:</hi> Or, in the Preacher's Language, to <hi>do whatſoever we attempt with</hi> the utmoſt of <hi>our might, becauſe there is no Device nor Knowledge,</hi> no Repentance, no Reformation, or Improvement of our ſelves, <hi>in the Grave,</hi> whither we are all going.</p>
            <p>From theſe three Conſiderations thus premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, you eaſily diſcern the ſubſtance of my Text to be this: <q>That it is the Duty of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as he values his Safety and his Soul, to bear conſtantly in mind, and make good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion againſt the Second Coming of the Lord; whether that be the Laſt Great Judgment, or, which in effect will be all one to Him, the Time of his own Death; ſince this is but a Preface to that Judgment, and only reſerves
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50998:7"/>him bound up in Fetters of Sleep and Earth, till the Almighty Judge ſhall unlock our cloſe dark Priſons, and Summon us all to our Trial.</q> For the <hi>Coming of the Son of Man</hi> in both theſe Senſes is ſure, and therefore it concerns every one to be ready: Eſpecially if we reflect again, that there is a hazard, nay, a high probability of his <hi>coming in ſuch an hour as we think not,</hi> which leads me to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Second Particular I promiſed to diſcourſe of, The Suddenneſs of the Son of Man's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in what Senſe that Quality belongs to it.</p>
            <p>Now an Accident is reputed Sudden, either with regard to the Time when it happens, or the Perſons to whom it happens; either when it comes immediately, and without any notice of it beforehand; or when it overtakes Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, at a Seaſon in which they leaſt think of it, and before they have competently arm'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt it. In the former of theſe Reſpects, the <hi>Son of Man's Coming</hi> is not, cannot be ſudden: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If by that Coming we mean the General Judgment, Who can have the Conſidence to pretend, that This is brought upon the World in a trice, and without ſufficient notice? Did not the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> above two thouſand
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50998:8"/>years ago, declare to his People what God had ſhewed him in a Viſion,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan. VII.</hi> 9, 10.</note> when <hi>his Throne was like a fiery flame, and his wheels like burning fire, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſands miniſtred unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him, when the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſet, and the Books were opened?</hi> Did not the ſame Mouth proclaim aloud in Chap. 12.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ch. XII</hi> 2.</note> 
               <hi>That they who ſleep in the duſt of the Earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting Life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt?</hi> So that even before the Light of the Goſpel ſhone forth, there were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations in abundance given, that the Almighty would ariſe to Judgment, and reward every Man according to his work. But we have a much ſurer word than that of Prophecy, The expreſs Teſtimony of our Bleſſed Lord, and his Holy Apoſtles;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh. V.</hi> 22.</note> That very Son <hi>to whom the Father hath committed all Judgment,</hi> tells us in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapter,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ch. XXV.</hi> 31, 32.</note> that <hi>He will come in his Glory, and all the Holy Angels with him, that he will ſit on his Throne, and all Nations ſhall be gathered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 31.</note> And in this Chapter, <hi>That he will ſend his Angels with a great ſound of a Trumpet, and they ſhall gather together his Elect from the four winds, from one end of Heaven to the other.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> accordingly hath forewarned the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and in Them all to whom that Epiſtle ſhould

               <hi>That we muſt all appear before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the things done in his Body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> He hath likewiſe preſſed the <hi>Athenians</hi> to ſpeedy Converſion and Repentance, from this moſt unanſwerable Argument,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts XVII.</hi> 31.</note> that <hi>God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a day in which he will judge the world in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, by that Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> acquaints us yet farther, That the delay of this Judgment had tempted ſome ungodly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate Wretches, to queſtion, whether there would ever be any ſuch thing. But while thoſe <hi>Scoffers</hi> ridiculed Religion, and rallied this uneaſie Doctrine, with that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plous Taunt, <hi>Where,

                     </hi> 3, 4.</note> where is the Promiſe of his Coming?</hi> He teaches Us to entertain quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Notions of the matter. <hi>Beloved,</hi> ſays he,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 8, 9, 10</note> 
               <hi>be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thouſand years, and a thouſand years as one day. The Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſe, as ſome men count ſlackneſs, but is long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance. But the Day of the Lord will come as a Thief in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50998:9"/>night.</hi> To all which, and many other expreſs Teſtimonies of Scripture, if we add the conſtant Dictates and private Impulſes, the Applauſes and the Reproaches of Conſcience, which, according to the Quality of each moral Action, never fail to ſtrike us with ſome expectations of a diſtant Reward or Puniſhment; If we reflect upon the Reaſonableneſs, the Neceſſity of ſuch a thing, in order to a publick Vindication of the Divine Juſtice, and a perfect clearing of the dark and myſterious methods of Providence, which with ſuch ſeeming Indifference diſtributes the Good and Evil Things of this preſent Life: Theſe will appear ſo many evident invincible Proofs of a future Judgment; and we cannot with any Forehead pretend, that Almighty GOD hath been wanting, either to inform us that it ſhall be; or to warn and fortifie us againſt it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But Secondly. If by the <hi>Son of Man's coming,</hi> be underſtood our own Death, alas! where do we not meet with freſh Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of that? Beſides, that Almighty GOD hath ordained this Coming, as a neceſſary Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the other,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr. IX.</hi> 27.</note> for <hi>It is appointed unto Men once to die, and after that, the Judgment;</hi> Beſides this, I ſay, every thing we ſee, or hear, or know, turns our Monitor, and we muſt be blind and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50998:9"/>deaf not to be ſenſible, and perfectly ſtupid, not to apprehend and conſider it. Every dying Year, every declining Day, every drooping Flower, and falling Leaf, are but ſo many Emblems of our certain Mortality. And, for fear we ſhould neglect theſe as Inſtances too remote, and too little concerning us, the continual Change of our own Bodies brings the Matter home, and makes the unwelcome Application for us. For in deſpight of all the vain Flatteries, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Reaſonings of Fleſh and Blood to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the unſteady condition of Human Nature is a moſt ſenſible, an ever-preſent Argument, that as <hi>Man comes up like a Flower,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job XIV.</hi> 2.</note> ſo there is no Remedy, but one way or other he muſt be <hi>cut down like it</hi> too. If he eſcape the rude Aſſaults of ſad untimely Accidents, if neither Violence crop him off, nor Sickneſs blaſt him in the Bud, yet the Slower decays of Age will be ſure to wither his Beauty, and make his Strength bend and ſtoop, till he be forced down into his native Earth again. And yet in all this Compariſon there is, as <hi>Job</hi> well obſerves, one mighty Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 7.8.9.10.</note> That of a <hi>Plant or an Herb there is hope, that it will ſprout again;</hi> The return of the Year and a kindly Seaſon may cheriſh it, or the Care of the Cultivater and Refreſhing Moiſture

               <hi>may make it bud,</hi> and <hi>hinder the tender Branch from ceaſing;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Or if the Examples of other Creatures be not drawn into Conſequence, nor the gradual Decays of our own Perſons duly attended to, yet where theſe have accompliſhed their full work, how prodigiouſly impenetrable muſt we be, not to take the Impreſſion? The ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nature is imparted to all Men, and all are liable to the ſame Dangers and Infirmities. Our own late ſad Experience hath convinced us, that neither Youth nor Vigour, neither Piety nor Power, is Defence ſufficient againſt this Fatal Blow. If any Humane Excellence could get above it; if the moſt Zealous Prayers, and United Wiſhes of Good People, could ſuſpend it; that Royal Patern of Virtue, whoſe Life was worth ten thouſand of Ours, had not ſo ſoon left us this moſt afflicting Inſtance, That not Any, not even the Greateſt, not even the Beſt, can have any pretence to think themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from a Deſtiny, that is inflicted without Diſtinction, upon Perſons of all Ages, all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and all Conſtitutions. And of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we have Experiments without number, the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50998:10"/>fulleſt Evidence that can poſſibly be given. For the laſt Groans and Agonies of departing Souls, the ſad Solemnities of Funerals, the dejected Looks and mourning Weeds of Melancholy ſurviving Friends, and the ſtill more melting Sighs and Tears of the poor Widows and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, bereaved of their beſt Comfort and Support; Theſe are Objects, that in every time, and every place, do ſo conſtantly preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to our view, that a Man muſt even go out of the World not to meet with them. How then ſhall we call that Coming of our Lord ſudden for want of ſufficient notice, which we are ſo many ſeveral ways, and ſo continually reminded of, that without doing the extreameſt Violence to our Reaſon, and our Senſes, it is impoſſible for us not to expect and daily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it?</p>
            <p>But I obſerved before, that an Accident is ſometimes reputed Sudden, as well in regard of the Perſon to whom it happens, as of the Time when it happens. And certainly, that Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation never met with ſo many Experimental Proofs in any one Inſtance, as it does in the Caſe before us. For it would really amaze any thinking Man, to reflect how the Generality of the World behave themſelves upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50998:11"/>and how very ſmall a part of their Care they make it, to provide for the Coming of their Lord in either of the forementioned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. They commonly profeſs, to believe a Future Judgment with the higheſt degree of Aſſurance that is poſſible; They make frequent and pathetical Harangues upon the Certainty of Death, and the Shortneſs of the Time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted us here upon Earth; They pretend too to be ſenſible, that upon this fleeting Moment depends an Eternity of Bliſs or Woe; That their Immortal Souls, and all that can be called Precious, lie at ſtake, and muſt be dealt with hereafter, as this little Span of Life is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved now: But ſtill, as if they had made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Death, and were in League with Hell; their Converſations argue a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Perſwaſion; their Affections and Deſires fix and terminate here below; and by a ſtrange ſort of unthinking Perverſeneſs, the periſhing Trifles of this World wholly poſſeſs and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them; while the main End and Buſineſs of their Creation, the Concerns of a Future and Better State, (which are in truth the only Things worth a Man's Conſideration and Pains,) are ſcarce allowed any place at all in their Thoughts and Memories.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:50998:11"/>
            <p>How Prodigious, and withal how Dangerous a Folly this wretched Negligence is, you need not be told any more, after what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready delivered in the Beginning of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. And therefore, without farther Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to repreſent it here, I ſhall deſcend to my</p>
            <p n="3">III. Third Particular, <q>Wherein I propoſed to lay down ſome Directions, how we may eſcape the Condemnation of ſuch careleſs Men, and what courſe we muſt take, to be found ready to meet our Lord at his Coming.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And here I ſhall inſiſt upon ſuch Rules only, as I find given by our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf upon this very Occaſion. Now they are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Four; Two of which are Negative, and regard ſome Vices, which muſt be declined; The other Two are Poſitive, and preſcribe ſome Duties to be obſerved. The Vices to be avoided, are <hi>Senſuality,</hi> and <hi>Love of the World;</hi> and againſt theſe our Lord gives this Caution:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke XXI.</hi> 34.</note> 
               <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs, and Cares of this Life, and ſo that Day come upon you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares.</hi> In which Words, the Advice is given in ſuch a manner, as at the ſame time to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Ground upon which it proceeds; and wherein the Danger of being addicted to ſuch
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50998:12"/>a Courſe of Life conſiſts. For by this means, it ſeems, Men are expoſed to Surpriſe, and apt to have their <hi>Hearts overcharged.</hi> My preſent Intent from hence is to ſhew, that This is the Natural and Unavoidable Conſequence of thoſe Vices, and ſo that they cannot but be moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Hindrances to a Chriſtian's Preparation for Death and Judgment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Former of theſe is Senſuality, which our Lord hath expreſſed by <hi>Surfeiting and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs;</hi> Intending I ſuppoſe hereby, not only thoſe two Sins, barely conſidered in themſelves; but all the curſed Effects of Gluttony and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and the many vile Luſts, and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, that are wont to follow thereupon. For the Indulging an Habitual Practice of theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diſcompoſes the Inward, no leſs evidently, than it diſtempers and deſtroys the Outward Man. For as here they pall the Appetite, viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the Palate, clog and dull the Animal Spirits, and in one word, render the Body a Sink of Diſeaſes and Ill Humours; the very ſame Effects in Proportion have they upon the Mind too. From hence Men's Love of God and Eſteem for Goodneſs grow faint and cold; Their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and Deſires are perfectly changed, and corrupted; They loſe all Reliſh of true and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50998:12"/>manly Satisfactions, and can no longer taſt any thing that is Rational, and Heavenly, and Pure. Thus, while they are gorged with carnal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, they become liſtleſs, and heavy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active; degenerate into Fleſh and Senſe; grow more and more unfit for any Attempt, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Men and Chriſtians; and at laſt lye ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſunk and buried in Spiritual Stupidity and Sloth. Now all this proceeds, partly from the Intimate Union between the Soul and Body, and partly from the Oppoſition between theſe Two in the Buſineſs of Religion. Hence it comes to paſs, that as oft as we pamper the Fleſh, we do at the ſame time not only load our Better and more refined part, but we cheriſh a deadly Foe too. Whereas on the Contrary, a Religious Sobriety keeps men awake and active; gives them leiſure to be cool and ſerious; admits ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary thoughts as Death and Judgment; and ſuggeſts, that upon Them depends the Bliſs which Immortal Spirits were deſigned to attain. A Senſual man hath only his Intervals, and ſhort ſnatches of Thinking, and even in Them, the Byaſs is upon his Judgment; and incredibly hard it is to raiſe him up to any tolerable Eſtimate of Heaven and Intellectual Joys. But Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Temperance leave us free and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50998:13"/>give us a right turn of Soul, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon room to exert it ſelf; They inſpire us with a generous diſdain of all Earthly Enjoyments, and diſpoſe us to thirſt after another World, rather than to take up with the Treacherous Soothings of This. For by removing our falſe Opticks, and ſhewing every thing to the naked Eye, they ſoon convince us, how very little the Gayeſt Man here can arrive at; the bitter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion Sinful Pleaſures are like to find; and the many Dreadful Snares and Inconveniences, which Eaſe and Luxury betray Men to.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second Thing our Bleſſed Saviour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes his Diſciples againſt, is the Love of the World.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk. XXI</hi> 34.</note> 
               <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that ye be not over-charged with the Cares of this Life.</hi> Where, by forbidding to engage too deeply in ſuch Cares, you may be very confident, it is no part of his meaning, that we ſhould ſo entirely lay our ſelves out upon the next Life, as to look after no proviſion for a Convenient Subſiſtence in This: But, as in <hi>Matt.</hi> 6. he blames ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Anxiety, as argue unworthy Diſtruſts of Providence, and ill ſute a Chriſtian's Faith; ſo here he condemns that criminal Exceſs of Care, which diſorders Men in their Duty, and takes their minds off from their own Mortality,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50998:13"/>and the Regard for another world. Every ones own Experience would quickly teach him, if our Saviour had not done it to his hand, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent things the ſervice of God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon are; and how impoſſible it is, at one and the ſame time, to be extreamly ſolicitous for this world's Goods, and to <hi>ſeek the Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs</hi> with any becoming degree of Affection and Zeal. The matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is ſo ordered, that theſe Cares in any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition are the moſt dangerous ſnares a Man can fall into. If he be poor, and ſtruggling hard for a Competency; Then they perplex and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract him, they fill him with a thouſand mean deſpondencies, and expoſe him to all the little ſhifts, and baſe Arts of unjuſt Gain. If he be wealthy, and a Deſire of increaſing Riches oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion it, nothing can be more directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the Duty of Preparation in my Text: For Abundance and Succeſs commonly inflame thoſe deſires, and render the mind but more Sordid and Abject; They faſten the Soul down to the vanities of this World, and will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to ſoar up to another. But above all, they render the thoughts of Death, and leaving thoſe belov'd Treaſures a moſt tormenting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. So that every way this immoderate
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50998:14"/>Solicitude is irreconcileable with a Chriſtian's making ready to meet his Lord. For the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Man that is over-charged with it, gives himſelf no leiſure to provide for his Coming; and the Rich Man cannot endure to think of it. And no wonder then if Men thus clogg'd and incumber'd do not eſcape that <hi>Snare,</hi> which the Goſpel ſays that Day ſhall prove to <hi>all them that dwell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk. XXI</hi> 35</note> but eſpecially to Them that ſo dwell, as to ſet up their Reſt, <hi>on the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the Two fore-mentioned Evils our Lord oppoſes as many Poſitive Virtues, which may aſſiſt and further us in our Proviſion for his Approach.</p>
            <p>The Former of theſe is Watchfulneſs. By which we are to underſtand in general, Frequent Meditations upon, and a continual Regard to that moſt Important Day. A having, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls it,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk. XII.</hi> 35.</note> 
               <hi>our Loins Girt, and our Lights burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> A diſcharging our ſelves from the burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Concerns of Life, and making all here ſit eaſie and looſe about us; and A Weaning our Affections from all ſuch Pleaſures, as might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and divert us in our Chriſtian Courſe And as Light is ſometimes with a peculiar Energy called <hi>Shining,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat V.</hi> 16</note> thus it denotes an exemplary Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, a Graceful Behaviour, and extraordinary
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50998:14"/>Diligence in our Calling; A Conſcientious maintaining the Poſt we are appointed to, and anſwering all that can be expected from us in our reſpective Stations and Capacities. Thus our Lord explains himſelf in the Verſes next after my Text, and that one Inſtance is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to infinite others,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 45.46.</note> 
               <hi>Who is a Faithful and Wiſe Servant, whom his Lord hath made Ruler over his Houſhold, to give them Meat in due Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Bleſſed is that Servant, whom his Lord, when he cometh, ſhall find ſo doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Once more. In regard our Task is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and our Avocations many; our Enemies Strong, and We of our ſelves but Weak, but very Weak; we are farther Adviſed and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to be frequent and diligent in calling in Succours from abroad; and applying our ſelves for Strength and Help, to Him who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can, and who will not fail in his due time to deliver us. <hi>Take ye heed,</hi>

            <p>But ſtill, nothing can be a more fatal Injury to us, than the relying upon our own Strength and Diligence, ſuppoſing This to be never ſo Faithful, That to be never ſo Great. For the very Beſt of us all, (God help us) does not ſo far conquer the Infirmities of Humane Nature, as to be always upon his Guard, but will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently find himſelf ſurpriſed; and hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abundant occaſion to Pray, both that he may be forgiven his former Inadvertencies, and enabled to ſtand faſter for the time to come. Eſpecially to Intreat and Implore with all the Earneſtneſs and Holy Paſſion imaginable, that <hi>In the Hour of Death, and in the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Good Lord would deliver him.</hi> That the Laſt mighty Change, upon which the whole of his future Fate muſt depend, may not find him Idle or Unprovided, but Awake and Buſie, Diſcharged of every Weight, and his <hi>Lamp lighted and trimm'd,</hi> that when the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> appears, he may have nothing to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50998:15"/>do, but to obey his Call, and <hi>Go in with him to the Marriage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed now in the laſt place to draw ſome few Inferences from what hath been ſaid, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And Firſt of all. We have here a very fair occaſion given us, of Contemplating the Exceeding Wiſdom and Juſtice of our Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Judge. His Wiſdom is eminently ſeen, in taking ſuch a Courſe to inform Men of this Second Coming, as is, of all others, the moſt proper, and likely to put them upon Preparing for it; and This vindicates his Juſtice, when he Puniſhes all thoſe, who do not Prepare for it accordingly. That he will moſt aſſuredly come, as that reſpects both our own Death and the Laſt General Doom, we have all the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty imaginable: But as to the punctual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe time of either of theſe Comings, he hath left us as utterly uncertain. Now this very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Dealing is the Strongeſt Argument in the World for Care and Circumſpection. For had that Critical Minute been revealed to every particular Man, this had been the way to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Licentiouſneſs and Security. The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Inclinations of Fleſh and Blood might have taken mighty Advantage from hence, to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:50998:16"/>perſwade Men, that ſome little of the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Life, the dregs of a Feeble old Age, would abundantly ſuffice to be dedicated to God; and a ſmall matter ſet all right between Them and ſo Gracious, ſo Forgiving a Maſter; That it were too much in all Reaſon to put themſelves under Reſtraints, and be perplexed for a Thing a great way off; and therefore they might ſafely indulge, and live at large, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their Days at leaſt; and thus many would have laid hold on but too fair a Pretence, for a late Reformation and Death-bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. We ſee daily how apt Men are to run theſe Riſques, as the Caſe ſtands now; and may reaſonably preſume, they would have been much more bold in venturing their Souls, had it been otherwiſe. But as it is, there can be no colourable Excuſe for ſuch a wicked Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. For the particular inſtant of a thing's happening, is but an Accidental, and Extrinſecal Circumſtance, and does not in the leaſt take off from the Reality and Certainty of the Thing. The Promiſes and Predictions of God are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable in this point; Where Eternal Truth ſtands engaged, the thing ſubſiſts in his Decree already; and what he hath ſo ſaid ſhall be brought to paſs, we ought to eſteem as Certain,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50998:16"/>(and in truth it is as certain every whit) as if our own Eyes beheld it now, performed in every Circumſtance. Come he will, That's beyond all Queſtion. But whether in <hi>the firſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mark XIII.</hi> 35.</note> or <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> or <hi>the third,</hi> or <hi>the fourth Watch,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell; And for this reaſon we ought to be extreamly circumſpect, and to watch always. Death and Judgment may overtake our Infancy, or they may ſnatch us away in the Heat and Bloom of Youth; or they may cruſh our riper and more confirmed Years; ſo that Health and Vigour will juſtifie no Man's being unprovided; But if they ſhould delay till <hi>the fourth Watch,</hi> till Old Age and Grey Hairs ſhed themſelves upon our heads, yet ſtill this Forbearance does not prove, either that they might not have broke in upon us ſooner, or that they will never do it at all. Againſt the former our Saviour uſes this very Motive to Caution in my Text; and to the latter I may very properly apply that paſſage of the Prophet <hi>Habakuk</hi> concerning his Viſion;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Habak. II</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>It is</hi> (ſays he) <hi>for an Appointed Time, at the End it ſhall ſpeak and not lie, though it tarry, yet wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, What hath been ſaid upon this Subject may ſerve for a very juſt Reproof to the Unreaſonableneſs and Vanity of ſuch Men, as are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50998:17"/>eternally bewailing the ſhortneſs of Life, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſuch Complaints, as ſeem to inſinuate, that God deals hardly with Mankind, in allowing them no longer a ſpace for the working out their Salvation. <hi>My Brethren let no man deceive you with vain words,</hi> Almighty God is a Fair and a Bountiful Maſter. He affords every one abundant Opportunities for the Work appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to do. Were They only to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Long-liv'd, who have finiſhed the Task and Buſineſs of Life, then (God knows) the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of People live but a very little while. But the Queſtion in this caſe muſt not be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch Men have actually wrought out their Salvation, but whether or no, ſuppoſing them to make the beſt uſe of their time, they might not have done it, if they would. And the true Chriſtian way of Computation is to meaſure Life by the Improvements made of it, rather than by a Term or number of Years, be they never ſo many. He that dies Old in Virtue, can never be ſo Young, as to die untimely; and he that is a ſtranger to this, tho' he ſhould equal the years of <hi>Methuſalem,</hi> yet as to all the true purpoſes of Living, is an Infant ſtill. In a word, If Men will trifle away their precious Hours, when they are perpetually told how much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50998:17"/>upon them, the Fault is their own, and who can help it? The ſhorteſt Life is ſufficient to bring a Man to Heaven, that will be Diligent and Careful, and therefore the ſhorteſt Life is long enough. For ten thouſand Ages can do no more; and to the Idle, the Senſual, and Secure, even thoſe ten thouſand Ages would be every whit as much too ſhort.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly and Laſtly. From what went before it does likewiſe appear, with what Prudence and Piety our Holy Mother the Church of <hi>England</hi> teaches all her Children to deprecate the Miſery, and Judgment of a <hi>Sudden Death.</hi> Sudden I mean in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its ſelf, when it is not uſher'd in by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Sickneſs, or ſuch viſible ſinkings of Nature, as God is commonly pleaſed to ſend before, for the more awakening ſignifications of his laſt great Call. 'Tis true indeed, not <hi>knowing what hour the Lord doth come,</hi> we ſhould expect him every hour; and the Suddeneſt Death will be no excuſe to them that do not ſo; but yet we have a great deal of Reaſon to wiſh and to pray, that ſo important a Change may approach with ſomething of Warning and Solemnity. The beſt of us all after his niceſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration will find employment enough for his laſt hours; and I am apt to believe it is very difficult even for Good men in health and vigour to bring themſelves into ſo ſerious a frame of mind, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the next world, as he may, who ſees and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50998:18"/>feels himſelf Juſt upon the brink of it. A new Scene of things and thoughts then opens it ſelf; ſuch as kindles a Zeal ſometimes, where it was not before; and makes it burn brighter, where it was. And oft we ſee ſuch glad foretaſts of Bliſs, as abundantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate the bodily pains, and make all a Good man's <hi>bed in his ſickneſs.</hi> Beſides all This, to be aſſiſted with the Advice of our Spiritual Guides, to be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the <hi>Viaticum</hi> of the Church, the Sacrament and Seal of our Redemption, to be recommended by the Interceſſions of our parting Friends; Theſe are mighty Comforts and Advantages. So that a linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſeaſe, which uſually paſſes for a great Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is in this reſpect a Great Bleſſing; for while Death makes regular and leiſurly advances, he deals with us like a Fair Enemy, calls aloud to the Field, and bids us make ready for the Combat. But to be hurried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into Eternity in a Trice; To have Body and Soul torn aſunder at one ſtroke, without one poor Minute or two allowed to take leave, without one <hi>Lord have mercy upon me</hi> at the laſt gaſp! Jeſus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us! for ſure this cannot but ſeem a dreadful thing to every conſidering Chriſtian. We will wiſh then, and we will pray earneſtly, that God would not deal ſo with us; but ſince it is poſſible, that he may uſe This as well as any other Method of calling us to himſelf, it will be as much as Heav'n and our Souls are worth, to take care that the ſuddeneſt <hi>Death</hi> may not be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50998:18"/>ſudden in reſpect of Us, but that we be always <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and upon our Guard, Provided and Ready, and therefore eſpecially ſo, becauſe, as my Text tells us, <hi>In ſuch an hour as we think not, the Son of Man cometh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, Were it neceſſary (as I hope, after what hath been ſaid, it is not,) to urge this Duty yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon you, I promiſe my ſelf that could not be done more ſucceſsfully, than by propoſing to Your Imitation that Royal Example, which ought, and certainly will not ceaſe, to live in our Remembrance and Admiration, as long as Time and Memory them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall laſt. But the Endeavouring to repreſent This, is attended with many <hi>Difficulties.</hi> For Bright Patterns in Chriſtianity, and Maſter-pieces in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are what a Man may ſhew reſpectful Intentions in Drawing, but there are few hands ſo Maſterly, that their Art and Colours can ever come up to the Life. Beſides, Your own Recollection can give you more lively Images of this kind, than all the Words in the World are able to expreſs;
<note place="margin">1 <hi>King. X.</hi> 8.</note> and <hi>Happy ſure were You,</hi> her Servants, <hi>who ſtood continually before Her,</hi> and ſaw and <hi>heard her Wiſdom</hi> and Goodneſs. Happy indeed, if you ſo ſaw, and ſo recollect, as in your own Lives to expreſs thoſe Graces, which rendred Her the Glory and Ornament of her Age, and Sex; the moſt conſpicuous, not of Queens only, but of Wives and Women; and to every Humble, and Charitable, and Devout Chriſtian, a Pattern of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50998:19"/>and Piety, and Condeſcenſion; of all that Sweetneſs and Good Nature, which Religion, and nothing but Religion, can inſpire Men with. But the Enlarging upon This Subject in This Place, and This Preſence, would be apt to provoke a Paſſion, which, though it might ſit well upon Friends and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; yet ill agrees with the Reflections of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, upon ſo Pious, ſo Majeſtick a Death. All there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I ſhall add is only This, That the Laſt Act of our Lives will depend upon thoſe that go before; and the only way to Die as your Admirable Miſtreſs did, is to Live as She did. When we can with Her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that our Proviſions for Eternity are not to make at our Laſt Hours, Then, and not till Then, may we hope to attain to ſome competent Degree of Her Magnanimity, and Noble Reſignation. Surpriſe is the moſt dangerous Diſtreſs, that can poſſibly befal us in that great Conflict; and They who have fenced themſelves well againſt This, may with an Eaſineſs and Compoſure, like Hers, look the King of Terrors in the Face, and Triumph ev'n in Death. And may the Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Virtues of our Sovereign excite this commendable Emulation in us all, That we may not only attend and rejoyce about her Heav'nly, as we did here about her Earthly Throne, but (which could not be done here) that we may partake of, and ſhare That Crown with her for Ever! Which GOD of his Infinite Mercy grant for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
